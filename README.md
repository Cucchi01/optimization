# Numerical optimization
In this project we implement and apply two optimization techniques, Nelder-Mead and Truncated Newton methods, to solve three distinct unconstrained minimization problems. The aim is to test and compare the methods and their performance with respect to the expected theoretical behavior, using different values for the parameters and starting points.  
In the case of the Truncated Newton method, we also present the results obtained using its preconditioned version and
matrix-free implementation.  

The MATLAB implementation of the two methods and various utility functions are present in the `utils\` directory, while their application on the third problem is stored in the `problem3` directory.  
The same procedure was followed for the first and the second problems. The problem descriptions, the theory behind the two methods, the references to the original works, the results, and their discussion are all present in the `report.pdf` file.
